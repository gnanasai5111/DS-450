**Heap**

Before getting to know about heap,you need to be aware of this terms.

->Array Representation of Binary Tree(fill level by level)
  -If a node is at index i,then its left child is (2*i) and right child is ((2*i)+1).
  -For a child node,if you want to find parent then it is (i/2).

->Complete Binary Tree
  -If you represent binary tree in array then there shouldnt be any empty spaces or null values in the array then it is called complete binary tree.
  -A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which 
   are filled from as left as possible.
  
->Heap
  -Heap is a complete binary tree.
  -Two types:Max and Min Heap
  -Max Heap:It is a complete binary tree and every node is having the element greater than or equal to all its descendants.
  -Min Heap:It is a complete binary tree and every node is having the element smaller than or equal to all its descendants.

->Insert(adjustment is done from leaf to root) and Delete(adjustment is done from root to leaf)
  -For inserting a value,insert at the end of the array ,and compare the value with parent and swaps the element if the value is greater than the parent for
   max heap and swaps the lement if the value is lesser than the parent for min heap.(Time complexity-o(1) to o(logn))
  -For Deleting ,we always delete the root node and after deleting we move the last array element to root and then we compare the root childs to see which is 
   greater for max heap and which is lesser for min heap,after getting the child value,we compare it with the parent ,for max heap if the child node is greater
   than the parent then swap and for min heap if the child node is lesser than the parent them swap.Repeat this procedure till all the elements are in correct
   position.(Time complexity - o(logn))
   
 ->Building an Heap(naive approach-left to right -bottom up)
 
class HeapBuild {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int a[]= {1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 13, 10, 9, 8, 15, 17};
       for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){                                         //  loop will run for n times-o(n)
           int j=i;                                               
           while(j>0 && a[j]>a[j%2==0?(j-1)/2:j/2]){                        // comaring the element with parent and swapping - o(logn)
                 int temp=a[j];
                 a[j]=a[j%2==0?(j-1)/2:j/2];
                 a[j%2==0?(j-1)/2:j/2]=temp;
                 j=j%2==0?(j-1)/2:j/2;
           }          
       }
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));                             //   overall -o(nlogn)
    }
}
  
  The code written runs in o(nlogn) time complexity.Its a bottom up approach and runs by inserting element from root.When we insert a new element to the parent
  then we compare the newly inserted child element to the ancestors amd swap them to form a max/min heap.
   
->Heap Sort
 -create a heap(o(nlogn)) and delete all the elements from the heap(o(nlogn)).
 
->Heapify(right to left and direction is from leaf to root(top-down))-o(n)
  -You start with leaf node and go till to root.firstly since leaf nodes doesnt have any child nodes you can ignore them.when you get into any non leaf node
    then check for the descendant elements and see which is greater/lesser for max/min heap and swap if neccesarry.
    
    Building an Heap(heapify) - o(n)
    
class Heapify {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int a[]= {1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 13, 10, 9, 8, 15, 17};
    //   To get the last non leaf node
    int lastNode=(a.length/2)-1;
       for(int i=lastNode;i>=0;i--){  
           heapify(a,i,a.length);
       }
       System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
    }
    public static void heapify(int a[],int index,int N){
        int leftChildIndex=2*index+1;
        int rightChildIndex=2*index+2;
        int largestIndex=-1;
        if(leftChildIndex<N && a[leftChildIndex]>a[index]){
            largestIndex=leftChildIndex;
        }
        if(rightChildIndex< N && a[rightChildIndex]>a[largestIndex]){
            largestIndex=rightChildIndex;
        }
        if(largestIndex>=0 && largestIndex != index){
            int temp=a[index];
            a[index]=a[largestIndex];
            a[largestIndex]=temp;
            heapify(a,largestIndex,N);
        }
        
    }
}

->Priority Queue(insert and delete-o(n))
 -for min heap,the smaller the number more the priority and for min heap,the larger the element more the priority.
