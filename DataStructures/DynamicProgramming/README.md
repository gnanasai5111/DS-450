### Dynamic Programming
It is an optmisation over plain recursion.It is an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, 
and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution
- Tabulation(Bottom up)
- Memoization(Top down)

***Top-Down Approach***:  This approach follows the memoization technique. It consists of recursion and caching. In computation, recursion represents the process of calling functions repeatedly, whereas cache refers to the process of storing intermediate results.

***Bottom-Up Approach***: This approach uses the tabulation technique to implement the dynamic programming solution. It addresses the same problems as before, but without recursion. In this approach, iteration replaces recursion. Hence, there is no stack overflow error or overhead of recursive procedures.
