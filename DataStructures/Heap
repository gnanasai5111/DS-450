**Heap**

Before getting to know about heap,you need to be aware of this terms.

->Array Representation of Binary Tree(fill level by level)
  -If a node is at index i,then its left child is (2*i) and right child is ((2*i)+1).
  -For a child node,if you want to find parent then it is (i/2).

->Complete Binary Tree
  -If you represent binary tree in array then there shouldnt be any empty spaces or null values in the array then it is called complete binary tree.
  -A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which 
   are filled from as left as possible.
  
->Heap
  -Heap is a complete binary tree.
  -Two types:Max and Min Heap
  -Max Heap:It is a complete binary tree and every node is having the element greater than or equal to all its descendants.
  -Min Heap:It is a complete binary tree and every node is having the element smaller than or equal to all its descendants.
