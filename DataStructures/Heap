Before getting to know about heap,you need to be aware of this terms.

->Array Representation of Binary Tree(fill level by level)
.If a node is at index i,then its left child is (2*i) and right child is ((2*i)+1).
.For a child node,if you want to find parent then it is (i/2).

->Complete Binary Tree
.If you represent binary tree in array then there shouldnt be any empty spaces or null values in the array then it is called complete binary tree.
.A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which 
 are filled from as left as possible.
