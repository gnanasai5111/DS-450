### Greedy algorithm
- It is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment.It doesnt matter whether the current best will provide the overall
optimal result.
- It follows top down approach.


## we can use Greedy alogorithm

1. Greedy Choice Property
If an optimal solution to the problem can be found by choosing the best choice at each step without reconsidering the previous steps once chosen, 
the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. This property is called greedy choice property.

2. Optimal Substructure
If the optimal overall solution to the problem corresponds to the optimal solution to its subproblems, then the problem can be solved using a 
greedy approach. This property is called optimal substructure.
